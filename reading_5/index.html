        <p>I think artists go into webiste building with different ideals. While this article makes it seem like artists are ignoring an opportunity to best represent themselves through a website that is personally designed to show their art in a perfect way, I take the side of the artist that uses their website as a white cube, a gallery space. There is something to be said about using a website as a piece, but it may be distracting from the overall work that is presented on the site. I think it is fair for artists to not expend energy on creating different formats for showcasing their own point of view.<br>
        That being said, I know that Postmasters Gallery on the Lower East Side represents a lot of artists that work in mediums that are not typically represented in galleries and museums because they are elements of the internet that cannot be sold or owned. These artists typically have sites that don't represent their own work per say, but let the viewer experience one point of view.</p>
