        <p>This was a refreshing take on what an artists website could possibly be. I've recently discovered that I work much more successfully in an analog way, by cutting and pasting in a tangible way for me first and then transitioning that work that I've done to the computer for the final piece or design. I'm excited to see how I can incorporate that into a website and play with the ideas of texture, pattern, and tactility in a digital way.</p>

        <p>Is it possible to create a wesite in this day and age that is not impacted by the structures of websites like Google and Facebook? What steps can be taken to ensure that my website works in an organic fashion rather than a refined design sense? How will this appeal or not appeal to those that interact with the website?</p>

        <p>Although this piece aimed to be informative on different systems and types of code, my biggest takeaway was that coding has nothing to do with computers, or having the best or newest system. Coding is a tool to put ideas out into the world, just like any other form of creative creation.</p>
