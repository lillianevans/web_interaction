        <p>The best part about recognizing that the newest art medium is the Internet is that the galleries already know this. Many galleries are working towards creating new ways to explore showing and selling this work...there is a way to monetize everything. As much as there is freedom of expression in this type of medium because it has not even begun to be defined yet, it also means that it is ripe for exploitation in many different ways. For example, Richard Prince's screenshots of other people's public Instagram posts that sold at the New York Frieze Art Fair in 2015 for $90,000 each. This could be considered to be the work of a Neenstar, assuming Prince knows about this. </p>
